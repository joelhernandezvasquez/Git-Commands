git rebase <name of the branch>: it rebase in this case it merges the commits to the branch. For example I am in the branch2
and I want to bring the commits from master branch so it will be git rebase master.

git rebase -i HEAD~4: rebase interactivo ~4 means the number of commits to see

squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into the previous commit

reword : git rebase -i HEAD~4 select r for reword
